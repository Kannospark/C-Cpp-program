***Projects of CS205 C/C++ Program Design of SUSTech in 2023 Spring, taught by [Shiqi Yu](https://github.com/ShiqiYu).***  

- The first project is about a calculator which can calculate extremely big numbers, for example 3e30 times 4e40.
- Second project is a comparision with speed of array multiplication between C/CPP language and JAVA language.
- Third project is about image revolution. Optimising the speed of revolution with SIMD and OMP, and implement the project to EAIDK-310 board which equipeed with ARM kernel.
- Forth project is to design a CPP class which extends the third project. checking memory leak and managing the space properly is siginificant in this project.
- Fifth project is to implement GEMM for double matrices in C or C++ and put all efforts into effiency. And compare the speed with OPENBLAS's `cblas_dgemm()` function.

***The code and report of each project are released. I will be pleasant if they can help you overcome the hard YuPP.***
